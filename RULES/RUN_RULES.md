# Rules for Balatro World Records Submissions

To ensure fairness and integrity in run submissions, users must adhere to the following rules:

1. **Video Recording**: Users must record a video of the entire run and upload it to YouTube or a similar video-sharing platform. The video must capture the entire gameplay session from start to finish without any edits, cuts, or alterations.

2. **Unedited Gameplay**: The submitted video must be unedited. Users are not allowed to splice, cut, or manipulate the footage in any way that could affect the authenticity of the run.

3. **Adherence to Terms and Conditions**: The run must comply with all the rules outlined in the platforms Terms and Conditions. This includes maintaining respectful conduct, fair play, and compliance with category rules.

4. **Appeal Process**: Users are allowed one appeal per run to dispute a ruling made by a moderator on a submission. Appeals must be submitted through the designated appeal process and will be reviewed by the moderation team.

5. **Unmodified Game Version**: The run must be performed on an unmodified version of Balatro. Any use of mods, cheats, or exploits that alter the gameplay or give unfair advantages is strictly prohibited.

6. **Ownership of Run**: The submitted run must belong to the user who is submitting it. Users are not allowed to submit runs performed by other players or claim ownership of runs that they did not personally achieve.

7. **Fair Play**: Users must not knowingly cheat, manipulate, or submit fake, fraudulent, or illegal runs. This includes exploiting glitches, using cheats or hacks, or engaging in any other behavior that undermines the integrity of the record.

Failure to comply with any of these rules may result in the disqualification of the submitted run and possible disciplinary action, including a permanent submission ban. Users are expected to uphold the highest standards of sportsmanship and integrity in their submissions.

If you have any questions or need clarification on these rules, please reach out to our moderation team.
